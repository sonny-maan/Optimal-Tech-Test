## Notes

This solution uses the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to show the user the distance between two UK postcodes, it assumes that the user would be driving. If I were to improve this solution further I would include a switch statement and prompt the user to select if they are driving, walking or cycling to their destination, as each would have a slightly different distance.
